# Week 2: Remote Sensing Fundamentals
-----------------

We will move on to learning about remote sensing in more detail, since remotely sensed data are a major component of most environmental databases. This will be an overview of some of the most important principles relevant to remote sensing, to get you started on your data journey!

## Topics We Will Cover:

* Basic properties of electromagnetic radiation
* Satellite orbits
* Spectral bands
* Using spectral band data to create true- and false-color images
* Satellite data processing levels and retrieval algorithms
* Coordinate reference systems and map projections
