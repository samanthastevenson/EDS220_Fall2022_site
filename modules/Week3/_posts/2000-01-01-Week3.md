## Week 3: Mapping, Gridding, and Data Quality Control

Now that we've gained some familiarity with data sources and some basic visualization tools, 
we'll learn more about creating maps in different _coordinate reference systems_ and the role that data _regridding and reprojection_ plays in
intercomparing datasets. We'll also work on understanding methods of _data quality control_ and dealing with _outliers_ in time series data.

---------------------------
## Topics We Will Cover:

* Map projections 
* Data gridding and regridding
* Reprojection and coordinate system conversion
* Data quality control and outliers
