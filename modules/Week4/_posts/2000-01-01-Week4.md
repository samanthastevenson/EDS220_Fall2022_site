## Week 4: More on Quality Control, Interpolation, and Regridding

This week we'll continue our work on understanding methods of _data quality control_ and dealing with _outliers_ in time series data. We'll also cover the major Python packages which allow us to perform _interpolation_ on datasets, including _regridding_ of multi-dimensional data.

---------------------------
## Topics We Will Cover:

* Data gridding and regridding
