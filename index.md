#### Learning Objectives

The goal of EDS 220 (Working With Environmental Datasets) is to provide MEDS students with the skills needed to efficiently locate, process, and manipulate the diverse sets of data encountered in environmental data science. Since these datasets are constantly evolving and encompass an enormous number of possible data sources, this course CANNOT provide a background in every possible source of data! But it will provide a grounding in best practices for searching and downloading datasets, as well as workflows for quality control and common postprocessing steps.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

* __Locate Environmental Datasets__ on major cloud computing platforms (Google Earth Engine) and API servers
* __Read In Datasets__ from these platforms onto a local machine
* __Perform Quality Control__ as needed, including infilling or interpolation of missing data
* __Subset/Aggregate Data__ according to the needs of a given application (spatial/temporal averaging, upsampling, etc)
* __Visualize Data__ including through creation of georeferenced maps, time series, and other basic metrics
* __Describe Data Pros/Cons__: which datasets are most appropriate for a given application, and why?
* __Work with Peers__ to create use case examples for datasets, and communicate to the rest of the class.
